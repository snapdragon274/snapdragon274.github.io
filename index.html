<p>in a far away country, there lived people who have never heard before of such magical devices called Git or GitHub.
One day a powerful wizard came into this country and stole a little girl, screaming and fighting, and finally following because he promised her ice-cream.
He broght the girl into his magic kingdom, where he ruled his land with subversion and kept the inferior people under control.</p>

<p>The little girl was lost. The people around her spoke in a different language. Though it sounded familiar to her, she couldn't understand what they wanted from her.
They used words like "fork" but they wouldn't eat anything with it. Talked of "branches" with not a single leaf that grew on them.
She felt so alone. </p>

<p>One gruesome day, the wizard stood in front of her. He seemed taller then ever before. Horrifying, terrible. Surrounded by dust and mist. He spoke in a loud, trembling voice:
"You shall create project pages!"</p>

<p>The girl cried in response: "How? Can I use my own crayons? Do you have any paper for me?"</p>

<p>"NO!" shouted the powerful wizard. "You foolish little thing! You'll have to climb the mountain of GitHub to find your answer! Rush! The deadly line is approaching fast!"</p>

<p>So the girl ran in fear. She had no idea how to fullfil his demand.</p>

<p>What should she do now?</p>

<p>...To be continued...</p>
