<p class="p2">&lt;a name="a-long-long-time-ago" class="anchor" href="#a-long-long-time-ago"&gt;&lt;span class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A long long time ago...&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;in a far away country, there lived people who have never heard before of such magical devices called Git or GitHub.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">One day a powerful wizard came into this country and stole a little girl, screaming and fighting, and finally following because he promised her ice-cream.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">He broght the girl into his magic kingdom, where he ruled his land with subversion and kept the inferior people under control.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;The little girl was lost. The people around her spoke in a different language. Though it sounded familiar to her, she couldn't understand what they wanted from her.</p>
<p class="p2">They used words like "fork" but they wouldn't eat anything with it. Talked of "branches" with not a single leaf that grew on them.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p2">She felt so alone. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;One gruesome day, the wizard stood in front of her. He seemed taller then ever before. Horrifying, terrible. Surrounded by dust and mist. He spoke in a loud, trembling voice:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">"You shall create project pages!"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;The girl cried in response: "How? Can I use my own crayons? Do you have any paper for me?"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;"NO!" shouted the powerful wizard. "You foolish little thing! You'll have to climb the mountain of GitHub to find your answer! Rush! The deadly line is approaching fast!"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;So the girl ran in fear. She had no idea how to fullfil his demand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">What should she do now?&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;...To be continued...&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2">&lt;/body&gt;</p>
